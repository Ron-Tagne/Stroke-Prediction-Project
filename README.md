# Stroke-Prediction-Project

 ## 1. ** Installation**
Installation of Python 3.10. 4, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit Learn libraries are sufficient to run the codes in the notebook.

## 2. **Project Motivation**
I was interested in creating a predictive model that could predict the likelihood of someone having a stroke.

## 3. **Data Source**

This dataset was sources from the 'Stroke Prediction' by Chris X. The dataset can be accessed via the Kaggle platform, at the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/docxian/stroke-prediction/data).

## 4. **File Descriptions**
There is one notebook file that contains the exploratory data analysis and model building. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the process for individual steps.

## 5. **Results**
The main findings and answers to the questions can be found on a blog post here

## 6. **Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements**
Must give credit to Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/docxian/stroke-prediction/data).
